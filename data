New York City, the most popular city in the United States, is a breeding ground for tourism. Whether you come to New York for the food, the musical and artistic talent, or the nightlife, choosing where you are going to stay is a very important part of the NYC experience! AirBnb, a popular lodging mobile app and website, has been altering the way that we think about where we choose to stay in a new place. The app has become increasingly popular since it was founded in 2008, and the hotel industry has been taking a huge hit ever since. The interesting thing about AirBnb is that, as long as you have a space for guests, anyone can be a host. Therefore, the app is extremely common in big cities like New York, where anybody can rent out their apartment or room for a ton of cash.

Using a sample of almost 50,000 AirBnb listings across all 5 boroughs in NYC in 2019, we gathered some useful information on the factors that AirBnb hosts consider when determining the price of their listings. This could help you in choosing the most affordable option that also satisfies your needs when traveling to NYC.   

As college students who love to travel, price is a huge consideration for us when choosing where to stay in a new city, and we are sure that many of you feel the same way. There is definitely a correlation between price and the location of each AirBnb listing in New York. As you can imagine, the more expensive the AirBnb is, the “better” the neighborhood that is located in. And the other way around as well; the cheaper the AirBnb, the “worse” the location it is in.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
AB_NYC_2019 %>%
  ggplot() + geom_boxplot(aes(x = price, y = borough, color = room_type)) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim =c(0, 500)) + labs(x = "Price" , y = "Borough" , title = "Price of Listings by Borough and Room Type in 2019")
```


This is a boxplot depicting the prices of the AirBnb listings in each borough, separated by room type: shared room, private room, or entire home/apartment. For each boxplot, the left edge of the box represents the 25th percentile of price, the middle line of the box represents the mean price, and the right edge represents the 75th percentile of price. All of the dots represent "outliers," because those prices are far from the mean, and there are not too many of them.

Brooklyn and Manhattan are both the most populated boroughs with AirBnb rentals, and therefore they also contain the highest mean price of listings. Out of just over 25,000 full home/apartment listings, over 13,000 belong to Manhattan, and over 9,500 belong to Brooklyn. Staten Island and the Bronx are low on this list, with 176 and 379, respectively. We can see from the graph that even as number of listings increase, price also increases. Therefore, the demand in Brooklyn and Manhattan is much higher than the demand in other boroughs. 

This pattern continues for the other two room types: private room and shared room. It is unsurprising that the average price for a private room and a shared room decreases tremendously from the entire home, as for most of the boroughs, the 75th percentile of the price of shared homes are less than the 25th percentile of the price of private homes. In addition, the average across all boroughs of the shared room type had an average price of $70.13, while the private room had an average price of $89.78, and the entire home/apartment had an average price over double that: $211.79. This is likely due to the lack of privacy that a shared home brings, since facilities are often shared, and guests will often have to interact with their hosts as they enter and leave the home. For New York City travelers, this is much less likely to be an issue than for travelers to an area where there isn't as much to do. NYC travelers are often out and about all day anyway, so if you don't mind seeing someone else, or possibly waiting to use the restroom, it will save you a ton of money to share a home with your host, or whoever else is occupying the space. 


Personally, we have never heard of "shared rooms" before we conducted this analysis, so we aren't entirely sure what that entails. It does sound like a bit too much privacy is extracted with that one, so since the price difference is not too severe, we would recommend the private room in a home as your best bet. 


Are you ever looking for the perfect place to stay and one of the listings catches your eye with just one word? Well, whether you realize it or not, the language used to describe AirBnb listings could possibly have more of an effect than you know. We compared the average and median prices of AirBnb listings in Manhattan that contained the word "cozy," and listings that contained the word "luxury," and compared both of those to the average and median prices of all of the listings in Manhattan.
